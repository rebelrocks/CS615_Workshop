# CS615_Workshop

MINI WEB APPLICATION WORKSHOP: FEEDBACKBOX


This	document	guides	the	reader	through	all	steps	needed	to	build	a	small,	self-contained	
web	application	with	HTML,	CSS	(incl.	Bootstrap) on	the	frontend,	PHP	on	the	backend,	and	
with	XML	as	a	storage	medium (something	that	can	be	extended	into	a	database).	It	shows	
how	to	set	up	the	entire	coding	environment	in	CodeAnywhere	and	how	to	connect	it	with	
GitHub	where	the	code	and	all	resources	are	kept	and	maintained.	
By	the	end	of	this	workshop,	you	should	have	good	idea	of	how	these	different	parts	of	a	
web	application	hold	together,	how	its	parts	communicate	and	how	the	data	flows.
